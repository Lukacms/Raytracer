## Project
Ray tracing is a technique used to generate realistic digital images by simulating the inverse path of light. Our goal here is to create a program from a file describing a scene.

We had the following objectives:
* have multiple types of primitives (Spheres, Planes, Cylinders, ...)
* have multiple types of lights (Point, Directionnal, ...)
* have at least an output to a ppm file
* load the elements from a json configutation file, using [nlohmann-json3](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/) library

### Dependencies
The project is done in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and build using [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

### Documentation

To have more information, look at the [docs](https://github.com/Lukacms/Raytracer/docs) folder.

## Build
To build the project, follow the steps below:
```bash
# Make sure you have the necessary system packages installed
# ⚠️ The following system packages installation commands may change depending on 
# your OS. Below example is for Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build clang-tidy-12 ccache
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-tidy clang-tidy /usr/bin/clang-tidy-12 100
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nlohmann-json3-dev libsfml-dev

# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Lukacms/Raytracer.git
cd Raytracer

# compile the project with flags required to close properly shared libraries, only available with g++
./compile.sh --gcc
```

Once the project is build, the `ratracer` executable is built at the root, and the plugins in the `plugins` directories:
```bash
.
├── plugins
│   ├── Catch2.a
│   ├── Catch2Main.a
│   ├── raytracer_ambiant_light.so
│   ├── raytracer-core.so
│   ├── raytracer_directional_light.so
│   ├── raytracer_moebius.so
│   ├── raytracer_plane.so
│   ├── raytracer_point_light.so
│   └── raytracer_sphere.so
└── raytracer
```

### Launch Project
After building project, here is the output of the help:
```bash
$ > ./raytracer -h
USAGE: ./raytracer <SCENE_FILE> <DISPLAY>
	SCENE_FILE: scene configuration
    DISPLAY: -ppm <FILENAME> | -sfml
```

You can launch the program with two options:
* `-ppm` with a `filename` specified, to output the file to the filename
* `-sfml` to render the result to a sfml window, which has the option to be quit using `Q`, and save to a ppm file with `S`
